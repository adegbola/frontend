This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

PITCH
 These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere - a park, an unfinished basement or a garage - not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held. Instructors can take attendance, request and process payments, create virtual “punch passes” for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more. Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app.

MVP
1. User can create/register as a "Client" and login with the registered credentials.(web, mobile)
2. User can create/register as an "Instructor" by entering an additional Auth Code during signup, and can login with the registered credentials.(web, mobile)
3. "Client" and "Instructor" are both presented with the appropriate onboarding walkthrough on first signin, with an option to skip it.(UX, mobile)
4. Authenticated "Instructor" can create update and delete a "Class". At a minimum, each "class" must have the following properties(web, mobile):

	* Name
	* Type
	* Start time
	* Duration
	* "Intensity" level
	* Location
	* Current number of registered attendees
	* Max class size

5. Authenticated "Instructor" can create "virtual" punch pass categories for each type of group fitness class they offer (yoga, insanity, RIPPED, HIGH, pilates, etc.)(mobile)
6. Authenticated "Client" can search for avaialble classes. At a minimum, they must be able to search by the following criteria(web, mobile):
	* class time
	* class date
	* class duration
	* class type
	* "Intensity level"
	* class location
7. Authenticated user can reserve a spot in a class with available seats open, and can reschedule or cancel their current reservation from the mobile app(mobile).
STRETCH
1. Implement payments using PayPal, Stripe or another 3rd party API(web, mobile)
